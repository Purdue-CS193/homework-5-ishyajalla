\subsection{It is not Microsoft Word}
LaTex is completely free to use! The same can not be said about Microsoft Word.

With LaTex, you can install hundreds of packages to use with your document. This gives you a great degree of customization that isn't found with Word pro-cessors. The possibilities are endless, ``All you need is a box, and imagination.''
